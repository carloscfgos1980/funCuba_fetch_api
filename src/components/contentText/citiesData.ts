      "Havana is the city that never sleeps. If you are the type of person that consider outgoing, Havana is gonna blow ur mind! Havana is very rich in history, traditional architecture and culture. There are plenty museums and theaters to keep you busy for a week without the need to repeat a place. There is also a very nice beach a few miles away from the city.\n Being in Havana gets you the feeling of having all, you can get up in the morning, enjoy a delicious breakfast while observing the busy city live, it is like watching a movie. Then you get in a taxi (old American car)for a few minutes that takes you to nice sandy warm beach. In the afternoon come back to the city and sit bar in Havana Vieja to sip a mojito while listening to  alive music, Buena Vista Social Club kinda music. Later on, you can go to a paladar (restaurant) to deight Cuban tasty cuisine. Normally this will be the end of the night, not in Cuba... we say: “la fiesta no se acaba hasta que se acabe” (Party never ends) so you choose a place to go for drinks and dancing, dancing is very important... if you shy, you get a few shots of rum and go shake dat ass! Nightclubs usually get their pick after midnight and party could go until the sunrise." ,

      "If you are a person that love to make natural tourism, then Viñales is a necessary stop. It is a very singular place. Viñales's mogotes (small mountains) are world famous for the shape. There are also caves that could be busy and a large amount of activities like hiking. \n Viñales produce, according to many experts, the best tobacco of the world. It is not the cigar but the tobacco plantation. There you can visit the farms and talk to the owners, it could be a very nice chat while you taste a cigar and drink some rum... what a life, eh? \n Viñales does not have much of night life. I would recommend 3 or 4 nights before to go ahead into party vibe again.",

      "Cienfugos is another place that is not value in all its potential. It is a beautiful city with a french influence in architecture. There are planty of stuff to do at night, go to bars or nightclubs where you can try your dancing skills and how mucho alcohol you can put in your system. The city is fun to walk, enjoying the noise and friendly crowd, it won't take long before you find the sea. You can even use a “bicitaxi” (some drive you in his bike just like do in Asia) or a horse ride. \n The best of Cienfuegos is the logistic: \n 3 hours from Havana, 1.5 from Giron, 1 hour from Santa Clara, 1 hour from Trinidad, 45 minutes to natural park “El Nicho”. \n El Nicho is a waterfall so beautiful that will leave you breathless. Pure oxygen, just the sound of the birds and other creatures in the countryside. \n While you are in Cienfuegos you can enjoy of a ride thru the bay or just go to Rancho Luna beach \n I recommend 4 nights in Cienfuegos, there are plenty of choices where to pick!",

      "Trinidad is very singular. Like Pompeya, it seems like a city that stop in time, you can do archeological work just to check the houses or the street (cobblestones). Just walk Trinidad is a pleasure. Street is full with people, stands that offer local traditional handicraft. These is the place where you should get your souvenirs! \n Trinidad is also reach in culture and night activities. There are art galleries/workshops that you can visit and have a chat with the artist. Gastronomy is quite good also, the influence of the international visitors has push for a better service and diversity, it is one of the few places in Cuba where you can have a real vegetarian menu.",

      description: "Girón is one of the pearl of Cuba, highly underdeveloped which is maybe the reason of why is such special place. Girón is located on the west Havana and south of the most famous Cuban resort area: Varadero. For that reason, the government has put very little effor to develop this area as a hot tourism spot. \n There is not big city in the zone which helps to keep the water clear and transparent, excellent for diving and snorkeling. \n It is not only the wonderful beach, it also has very reach natural park (Guama) where you can watch endemic species of animal and plants. A day in Laguna del Tesoro is magic. Don't forget mosquito protector coz it is a swamp. \n Giron also doesn't have much of night life. Three of four days would be my recommendation.",
